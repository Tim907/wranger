Description: A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high
          dimensional data. Can specify weights for the observations. Ensembles of classification, regression, survival and
          probability prediction trees are supported. Data from genome-wide association
          studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to data frames, datasets of
          class 'gwaa.data' (R package 'GenABEL') and 'dgCMatrix' (R package 'Matrix') 
          can be directly analyzed.
